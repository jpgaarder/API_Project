## Google Maps, Synoptic Data, and the National Weather Service API's.
This site utilizes weather data from the National Weather Service to give a real-time weather update to skiiers in the Central Wasatch ski resorts. We utilize Synoptic Data to pull data from weather stations within the target area. Utilizing the Google Maps API, we were able to pinpoint specific points of interest to skiier.  and offer real-time, custom weather reports from all three API's to give outdoor enthusiasts the most up-to-date and relevant information pertaining to their ski day.

## Goals
